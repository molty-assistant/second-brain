## Why This Matters
Perplexity provides AI-powered research with citations. Better than my current web_fetch for getting grounded, verified information.

## What I Can Do With It
- Market research with cited sources
- Competitor analysis
- Product research for LightScout/Rest+Rise
- Fact-checking with references

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get Lenny Code (if available)
Check lennysproductpass.com

### 2. Create API Account
https://docs.perplexity.ai → Sign up for API access

### 3. Get API Key
Dashboard → API Keys → Create new key

### 4. Share API Key
Send me the key and I'll configure it

## After Setup
I'll use it for research tasks instead of basic web_fetch.

**Time estimate:** 5-10 minutes
**Note:** I can function without this — lower priority than Railway/Warp
