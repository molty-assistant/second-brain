Sign up at **upload-post.com** (free tier: 2 profiles, 10 uploads/mo).

1. Create account
2. Connect LightScout social accounts via OAuth (whichever exist: X, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, Threads)
3. Go to dashboard → copy the **API key**
4. Give API key to Molty

This unlocks the full distribution pipeline — Molty can then schedule and post content across all connected platforms autonomously.
