## Why This Matters
ClawdHub is OpenClaw's skills marketplace. New skills could give me additional capabilities (integrations, tools, automations).

## What I Can Do With It
- Search for useful skills
- Install new capabilities
- Stay updated on OpenClaw ecosystem

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install CLI
```bash
npm install -g clawdhub
```

### 2. Verify
```bash
clawdhub search "automation"
clawdhub list
```

## After Setup
I'll periodically search for relevant skills and recommend any that look useful.
