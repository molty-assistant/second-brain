notes: "Out of all the tooling on lennys product pass, what might help you? I was thinking something like lovable or bolt or replit, basically so you could use it to create websites for me, even our Mission Control could potentially  be there? Or a way for you to easily deploy the sites so I could check them locally? Check out all the tools he has and let me know what's best, even something like warp? you tell me what would help you\r\n\r\nhttps://lennysproductpass.com"
