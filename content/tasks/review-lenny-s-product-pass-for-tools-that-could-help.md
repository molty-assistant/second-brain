notes: "Out of all the tooling on lennys product pass, what might help you? I was thinking something like lovable or bolt or replit, basically so you could use it to create websites for me, even our Mission Control could potentially  be there? Or a way for you to easily deploy the sites so I could check them locally? Check out all the tools he has and let me know what's best, even something like warp? you tell me what would help you\r\n\r\nhttps://lennysproductpass.com"

## 🦉 Molty's Analysis

Reviewed all 26 tools on Lenny's Product Pass. Here's what would actually expand my capabilities:

### 🏆 Top 3 Recommendations

#### 1. **Lovable** or **Bolt** — Build apps without your machine
These let me create full web apps just by prompting. I could:
- Build landing pages for LightScout/Rest+Rise
- Create internal tools and dashboards
- Prototype ideas overnight for your review
- Deploy to their hosting (you just get a link)

**Why it matters:** Right now I can only build things that run on your Mac. With these, I build → you get a live link. No setup.

**Pick one:** Bolt if you want speed/simplicity, Lovable if you want more polish. Both have Lenny codes.

#### 2. **Railway** — Deploy anything I build
Cloud platform for hosting. If I build something locally (like Mission Control), I could deploy it to Railway so:
- You can access it from anywhere (not just localhost)
- Your girlfriend could see the holiday shortlist without your Mac running
- Persistent hosting for tools we create

#### 3. **n8n** — Workflow automation
Visual workflow builder. I could set up:
- Automated monitoring (check LightScout reviews daily, alert you)
- LinkedIn activity tracking
- Recurring reports
- Integrations between tools

### 🤔 Honourable Mentions

| Tool | What it would give me | Priority |
|------|----------------------|----------|
| **ChatPRD** | Draft PRDs for LightScout/Rest+Rise | Nice to have |
| **Gamma** | Create presentations/pitch decks | When needed |
| **Perplexity** | Better research (I have web_fetch but limited) | Low (I manage) |
| **Warp** | Better terminal for my dev work | Low (I have exec) |

### ❌ Not Useful For Me

- Superhuman, Granola, Raycast — These are for *you* to use, not me
- Devin, Factory, Amp — Overkill, I can already code
- Framer — Lovable/Bolt do this better for our use case

### 📋 Recommendation

**Start with Lovable or Bolt** — biggest unlock for my autonomy. I can start building things tonight that you wake up to as live links.

**Then Railway** — so I can deploy our local stuff (Mission Control) to the web.

**Later n8n** — once we have more things to automate.

Want me to sign up to any of these? Or do you want to grab the Lenny codes first?

## 🦉 Update: Full Deep Dive Complete

See **Documents → "Lenny's Product Pass — Deep Analysis for Molty"** for the complete analysis of all 26 tools including:
- Access method for each (API/CLI/MCP/Browser)
- Whether I can actually use it
- Detailed use cases
- Prioritized recommendations

**Key finding:** CLI/API tools (Railway, n8n) are highest confidence. Browser tools (Bolt, Lovable, Replit) are possible but need testing.
