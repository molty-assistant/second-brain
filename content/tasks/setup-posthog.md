## Why
GoatCounter tells us how many visitors. PostHog tells us what they do — funnels, retention, feature usage. Essential for measuring marketing impact.

## What I Need
- PostHog project API key
- Project ID

## What I'll Do With It
- Integrate into all 5 web apps
- Query via REST API for automated reports
- Build into the marketing tool for campaign analytics
- No dashboard needed — I query the API directly
