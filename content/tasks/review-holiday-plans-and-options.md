  Research done, shortlist created, girlfriend-friendly page built. Parked until

Would be great if you review it all, maybe even put it together in a nicer view, make it easy for my girlfriend to review it

## ✅ Done by Molty

Created two views:

1. **Markdown shortlist** → Documents → "Holiday Shortlist — Dec 2026 / Jan 2027"
2. **Girlfriend-friendly webpage** → http://localhost:3000/holiday-shortlist.html

Top 3 recommendations:
1. 🇬🇭 **Ghana** — Best overall match (direct flights, perfect timing, culture + nature)
2. 🇧🇷 **Brazil Green Coast** — Beach + jungle, iconic bucket list
3. 🇪🇸 **Gran Canaria** — Pure hiking, zero jet lag

Ready for you both to review!

So your task wasn't just create the page, this is ongoing.
- Check what the other AI tools produced.
- Find other ideas.
- Keep thinking how you could hep here.

For the review page you created:
- It doesn't contain all of the ideas, it should contain everything we need to know, flights, links, all holiday choices.
- We need links to the exact tours.
- think of anything else you could add in thee
