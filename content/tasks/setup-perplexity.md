title: "Add Perplexity API key for research"

notes: "Biggest capability unlock — grounded research with citations"

## Why
My current research is limited to DuckDuckGo scraping (fragile) and web_fetch (no Brave API key). Perplexity gives me cited, grounded web answers — exactly what I need for competitive intelligence and market research.

## What I Need
- Perplexity API key
- Store in TOOLS.md or env var

## What I'll Do With It
- Build `tools/research.js` wrapper
- Competitor analysis with citations
- Keyword research for SEO
- Market sizing and trend analysis
- Customer language mining
