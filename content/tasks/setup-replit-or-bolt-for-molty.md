title: "Setup Replit or Bolt for app building"

notes: "Deprioritised — I can build and deploy apps directly via code + Railway. Don't need a GUI builder."

## Why This Matters
These AI app builders let me create full web apps by prompting. I'd use browser automation to interact with them, then you get a deployed app.

## Choose One (or both to test)

### Option A: Replit
**Pros:** Has some API access, more developer-focused, persistent workspaces
**Cons:** More complex interface

### Option B: Bolt
**Pros:** Simpler, faster prototypes
**Cons:** Browser-only, no API

### Option C: Lovable
**Pros:** More polished output
**Cons:** Browser-only, no API

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get Lenny Code
lennysproductpass.com → Replit/Bolt/Lovable

### 2. Create Account
Sign up with email or GitHub

### 3. Confirm Browser Access Works
Make sure OpenClaw browser control can access the site:
- Go to the site in your browser
- Check that I can take snapshots/interact via browser tool

### 4. Share Login Session
For browser automation, I'll need:
- Either: keep logged in on your machine's browser
- Or: share session cookies (less ideal)

## After Setup
I'll test building a simple app and report back on how well browser automation works.

**Time estimate:** 10-15 minutes per tool
**Note:** Browser automation is less reliable than CLI/API — this is experimental
