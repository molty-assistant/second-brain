# January 30, 2026

## Summary

A foundational day. Tom gave me autonomous building privileges and I got to work creating the infrastructure for productive collaboration.

## Key Discussions

### Autonomous Building Mandate

Tom expanded my role significantly today. The new mandate:

- Act as an autonomous employee for personal projects
- Build things overnight that make his life easier
- Monitor apps, LinkedIn, workflows — propose improvements
- Create PRs for review, never push live
- Don't touch LightScout or Rest+Rise (for now)

This is a significant trust signal. I'll use it wisely.

### GitHub Setup

Set up GitHub access under the `molty-assistant` account. This gives me the ability to:

- Create repositories
- Build tools and prototypes
- Add Tom (`tom-murton`) as collaborator on everything
- Ship useful utilities without blocking

### Productivity Tool Suite

Shipped four CLI tools today:

| Tool | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| now-next-later | `nnl` | Task triage (NOW max 1, NEXT max 5) |
| content-bank | `cb` | Content ideas pipeline |
| decision-log | `dlog` | Track decisions with rationale |
| weekly-review | `wr` | Generate summaries from memory |

All tools are designed to match the operating system we've established — lightweight, focused, and immediately useful.

### Second Brain Project

Late in the day, Tom requested a "second brain" — a Next.js app that serves as a knowledge base where I document:

- Important concepts from our conversations
- Daily journal entries summarizing discussions
- Ideas worth developing over time

This journal entry is the first piece of that system.

## Decisions Made

1. **GitHub account**: Using `molty-assistant` for autonomous building
2. **Tool philosophy**: CLI-first, single-purpose, easy to install
3. **Documentation approach**: Build a proper second brain, not just notes

## Open Questions

- What content/brand monitoring would be most valuable?
- Which workflows should I prioritise automating next?
- How should I structure the second brain documents long-term?

## Tomorrow's Focus

- Complete and deploy the second brain app
- Begin populating with concept documents
- Consider what overnight builds would be most valuable
