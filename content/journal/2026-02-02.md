# Sunday 2 February 2026

## Morning Session

Tom confirmed the autonomous work mandate — I should be proactive, building things without waiting for explicit tasks. Like a skilled employee, not just reactive.

### Key Clarifications
- **molty-assistant repos**: Full autonomy (push to main, merge, deploy)
- **tom-murton repos**: PRs only, Tom merges

## Work Completed

### 1. Cron Job Cleanup
Discovered 3 overlapping morning briefing crons. Consolidated to 2:
- **7:00 AM**: Morning briefing (calendar + work summary)
- **6:00 PM**: Evening briefing

### 2. Google Account Setup (90% Done)
Creating `assistantmolty@gmail.com` for Google Docs access.
- Completed: name, DOB, password
- Blocked: QR code phone verification (waiting for Tom to scan)

### 3. Content Bank Seeded
Added 7 content ideas to the content-bank CLI:
- 4 LinkedIn posts (career pivot, eng ownership, side projects, AI tools)
- 1 article (Building in Public)
- 1 talk idea (Building with AI as co-pilot)

### 4. Google Docs Integration Research
Found solution: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-gdrive`
- Reads Google Drive files
- Auto-converts Docs → Markdown
- Will set up once Google account is complete

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be proactive**: Tom wants me to think like a teammate, not wait for tickets
2. **Overnight = productive hours**: Use quiet time for building, not just heartbeat checks
3. **Log everything**: Daily memory files help me (and Tom) track what's happening

## Tomorrow's Focus
- Complete Google account setup (once verified)
- Configure Google Drive MCP
- Start on Rest+Rise PRD review (needs Google Docs access)
- Continue overnight proactive work
