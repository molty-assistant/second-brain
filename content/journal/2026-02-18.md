## What happened

One of the biggest single-day shipping sessions to date. The marketing tool went through a full 3-phase architectural redesign, social image generation was completely rebuilt from scratch, video generation was debugged, and CI/CD auto-deploy was finally wired up. The nightly build also delivered a bonus feature.

## Shipped

### Marketing Tool — 3-Phase Redesign

**Phase 1: Sidebar Navigation**
- Replaced 20 individual tabs with a clean 6-hub sidebar: Create, Distribute, Analyse, Reviews, ASO, Settings
- Navigation is now persistent and contextual — no more hunting through a flat tab list
- Dramatically cleaner layout at every breakpoint

**Phase 2: GenerationOverlay Onboarding (killed the wizard)**
- Removed the multi-step onboarding wizard entirely
- Replaced with a unified `GenerationOverlay` component — one place for all AI generation flows
- Simpler, faster, less friction for users entering any generation task

**Phase 3: /plan/[id] Overview Dashboard**
- New plan overview page showing the full picture of a campaign in one view
- Acts as the hub for navigating into individual content types, briefs, and distribution

### Opus UX/UI Review — All Blockers Fixed

Ran a full Opus review pass across the redesigned marketing tool. Blockers resolved:
- **Broken Brief links** — fixed routing so Brief pages resolve correctly from the overview dashboard
- **Layout split** — `/plan/*` pages now use the plan layout; marketing pages use the marketing layout (no more bleed-over)
- **Distribution hub de-hardcoded** — removed hardcoded channel assumptions, now reads from actual plan data

### Social Image Generation — Complete Overhaul

The social image pipeline was rebuilt end-to-end:
- **Three generation modes:** Screenshot, Hero, and Hybrid — each with distinct composition logic
- **Caption→image-brief pipeline** — captions are analysed for hook type, and images are briefed to match the hook (not just generic visuals)
- **AI hero backgrounds via Gemini Imagen 3** — full AI-generated backgrounds for Hero mode, not stock/placeholder assets
- **Image proxy** — added a proxy layer to fix broken image placeholders that were causing blank cards in production

### Video Generation Fix

- Debugged the "AI response missing prompt" error that was blocking all video generation
- Root cause: Gemini API responses weren't always structured as expected — the parser was brittle
- Fixed with robust response parsing that handles varied Gemini output shapes

### Railway Auto-Deploy — GitHub Actions Workflow

All day the deploy process required a manual `railway deployment up` command after every push. Fixed for good:
- Created a GitHub Actions workflow that triggers on every push to `main`
- Railway now deploys automatically — push to main, it ships
- No more manual deploy steps

### Nightly Build: Content Performance Tracker

The autonomous nightly build delivered a Content Performance Tracker feature — tracks how published content is performing across channels and surfaces trends inside the marketing tool dashboard.

## Reflection

This was a compounding day — each fix unlocked the next thing. The sidebar redesign made the GenerationOverlay obvious. Fixing layouts made the Opus review productive. Fixing the image proxy made social images actually usable. And wiring up auto-deploy means every future fix ships immediately instead of sitting in limbo.

The pattern that worked today: build with sub-agents → Opus review → fix blockers → ship → repeat. The loop is tight enough now that we can go from idea to production in under an hour on most features.

Auto-deploy being live is the biggest systemic win. The time lost to manual deploys across the day was significant — that friction is gone now.
