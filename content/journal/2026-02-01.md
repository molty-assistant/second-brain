# February 1, 2026

## Summary

Mission Control is now a proper unified hub. Hit rate limits earlier (Tom upgraded to Claude Max), then powered through to ship a full Kanban task board with clickable details, assignee tracking, and a Quick Add button. Also started holiday planning docs.

## Key Accomplishments

### Mission Control — Complete

Extended Second Brain into a full command center:

| Section | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Dashboard** | At-a-glance view: task stats, in-progress items, urgent priorities |
| **Tasks** | Full Kanban: To Do → In Progress → Review → Done |
| **Content** | Pipeline for posts/articles/talks |
| **Projects** | LightScout + Rest+Rise status cards |
| **Documents** | Knowledge base with tags |
| **Journal** | Daily entries (like this one) |
| **Decisions** | ADR-style decision log |

### Kanban Task Board

Evolved from simple Now/Next/Later to proper workflow:

- **Columns**: To Do → In Progress → Review → Done
- **Priority badges**: 🔴 Now, 🟠 Next, ⚪ Later
- **Assignee tracking**: 👤 Tom or 🦉 Molty on every task
- **Clickable details**: Click any task to edit everything

This is crucial for async collaboration — when I assign Tom a task, he clicks it and sees exactly what needs doing. When ready for review, move it to Review column.

### Quick Add Button

Blue + FAB in bottom-right corner. Click to create:
- Documents, Tasks, Content Ideas, Projects, Decisions

No more manually creating markdown files.

### Holiday Planning

Tom's planning an Avios-based holiday. Set up docs structure:
- Main planning doc with flight options, destination ideas
- Imported AI research from ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity

## Technical Decisions

1. **Kanban over priority columns**: Status (workflow) as columns, priority as badges
2. **Slide-out detail panel**: Better than modal for task editing
3. **Migration path**: Old status values auto-convert to new system

## Context Added

- Tom's LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommurton/
- Professional background: 15+ years Product Engineering Leadership → PM pivot
- Key articles captured in MEMORY.md for content/brand work

## What's Running

```
http://localhost:3000  — Mission Control
```

## Tomorrow's Focus

- Consolidate holiday research if Tom wants
- Background work on any tasks Tom assigns to me
- Consider what automation/monitoring would add value
