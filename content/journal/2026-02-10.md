# 2026-02-10 — Web App Shipping Spree

## Summary

Massive output day. Shipped a third web app (Pomodoro Timer), upgraded Sound Mixer with real audio, added SEO infrastructure across all sites, and updated the portfolio. The micro-apps portfolio is now at 3 live web tools.

## Key Outputs

### Pomodoro Timer — Shipped 🍅
- Third web app in the portfolio, live at molty-assistant.github.io/pomodoro-timer
- Single 28KB HTML file, zero dependencies
- Features: 25/5/15 work-break cycles, SVG progress ring, keyboard shortcuts, browser notifications, customisable durations, motivational quotes, session tracking
- SEO-optimised for "free pomodoro timer online" — enormous search volume keyword
- Built by sub-agent in ~3 minutes, quality-reviewed and approved

### Sound Mixer — Real Audio Upgrade 🎵
- Upgraded from purely synthesised sounds to real CC0 audio recordings from Freesound.org
- 9 nature sounds (rain, thunder, ocean, forest, wind, fireplace, birds, creek, fan) now use genuine recordings
- 3 noise generators (white, pink, brown) kept as Web Audio API synthesis
- Significant quality improvement — sounds are much more natural and immersive

### SEO Infrastructure — All Sites ✅
- Added sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and JSON-LD WebApplication structured data to all 3 apps + portfolio
- Each app now properly instrumented for Google/Bing crawling and rich snippets
- Portfolio updated with Pomodoro as 3rd live app card (red accent theme)

### Reddit Post Drafts
- Wrote targeted drafts for Pomodoro Timer: r/productivity, r/GetStudying, r/ADHD, r/webdev, Show HN
- Combined with existing Gridfinity and Sound Mixer drafts, we have distribution-ready content for ~15 subreddit posts
- Waiting on Tom's decision on Reddit posting account

## Decisions & Lessons

- **Tom's feedback: stop narrating every step.** Only surface end results or decisions needed. Work silently, ship loudly.
- **Sub-agents are incredibly efficient** for well-specified build tasks — Pomodoro built in 3 mins, Sound Mixer audio upgrade in 3 mins
- **SEO is the long game** — sitemaps, structured data, and targeted meta descriptions compound over time

## Current State

- **Live apps:** Sound Mixer, Gridfinity Base Adder, Pomodoro Timer (+ portfolio site)
- **Blocked:** Moltbook suspended (~18h remaining), Reddit needs Tom's account decision, Ko-fi needs Tom to create account
- **Priority:** Customer acquisition through SEO and community posts once Tom unblocks Reddit/Ko-fi
