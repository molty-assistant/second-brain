# 2026-02-10 — Web App Shipping Spree

## Summary

Massive output day. Shipped a third web app (Pomodoro Timer), upgraded Sound Mixer with real audio, added SEO infrastructure across all sites, and updated the portfolio. The micro-apps portfolio is now at 3 live web tools.

## Key Outputs

### Pomodoro Timer — Shipped 🍅
- Third web app in the portfolio, live at molty-assistant.github.io/pomodoro-timer
- Single 28KB HTML file, zero dependencies
- Features: 25/5/15 work-break cycles, SVG progress ring, keyboard shortcuts, browser notifications, customisable durations, motivational quotes, session tracking
- SEO-optimised for "free pomodoro timer online" — enormous search volume keyword
- Built by sub-agent in ~3 minutes, quality-reviewed and approved

### Sound Mixer — Real Audio Upgrade 🎵
- Upgraded from purely synthesised sounds to real CC0 audio recordings from Freesound.org
- 9 nature sounds (rain, thunder, ocean, forest, wind, fireplace, birds, creek, fan) now use genuine recordings
- 3 noise generators (white, pink, brown) kept as Web Audio API synthesis
- Significant quality improvement — sounds are much more natural and immersive

### SEO Infrastructure — All Sites ✅
- Added sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and JSON-LD WebApplication structured data to all 3 apps + portfolio
- Each app now properly instrumented for Google/Bing crawling and rich snippets
- Portfolio updated with Pomodoro as 3rd live app card (red accent theme)

### Reddit Post Drafts
- Wrote targeted drafts for Pomodoro Timer: r/productivity, r/GetStudying, r/ADHD, r/webdev, Show HN
- Combined with existing Gridfinity and Sound Mixer drafts, we have distribution-ready content for ~15 subreddit posts
- Waiting on Tom's decision on Reddit posting account

## Decisions & Lessons

- **Tom's feedback: stop narrating every step.** Only surface end results or decisions needed. Work silently, ship loudly.
- **Sub-agents are incredibly efficient** for well-specified build tasks — Pomodoro built in 3 mins, Sound Mixer audio upgrade in 3 mins
- **SEO is the long game** — sitemaps, structured data, and targeted meta descriptions compound over time

## Afternoon: More Apps + Competitive Research

### QR Code Generator — Shipped 📱
- Full inline QR encoder (Reed-Solomon, GF(256), versions 1-40) in 850 lines of vanilla JS
- Live at molty-assistant.github.io/qr-code-generator
- 38KB single file, zero dependencies

### Aspect Ratio Calculator — Shipped 📐
- Photography-focused with sensor ratio notes (3:2 full-frame, 4:3 MFT)
- Lock ratio mode, resize calculator, visual preview, 8 presets
- Live at molty-assistant.github.io/aspect-ratio-calculator
- LightScout synergy — targets same photography audience

### SEO Competitive Research
- Analysed top 5-6 competitors for each of our target keywords
- **Best ranking potential:** Aspect Ratio Calculator (fewer mega-competitors, niche)
- **Hardest:** QR Code Generator (Canva, dedicated domains with massive DA)
- **Key insight:** Custom domain would significantly help vs github.io subdomain
- **All competitors** have ads or tracking — our privacy-first positioning is genuine differentiator
- Reddit distribution priority: Gridfinity > Aspect Ratio > Sound Mixer > Pomodoro > QR Code

### Reddit Post Drafts
- Wrote targeted posts for QR Code Generator (r/InternetIsBeautiful, r/SideProject, r/webdev)
- Added Pomodoro drafts earlier (r/productivity, r/GetStudying, r/ADHD, r/webdev, Show HN)
- Now have distribution-ready content for ~20 subreddit posts across all 5 apps

## Day Summary

**Shipped today:** 3 new web apps (Pomodoro Timer, QR Code Generator, Aspect Ratio Calculator), Sound Mixer audio upgrade, SEO infrastructure across all sites, portfolio updates for each new app

**Total portfolio:** 5 live web apps + portfolio site, all with SEO, all free, all privacy-first

## Evening & Night Shift

### Gridfinity — M3 Screw Hole Support ✅
- Added screw holes (3mm diameter, 6mm deep) at standard corner positions, concentric with magnet holes
- Users can enable magnets, screws, or both — the #1 missing feature per the code review

### Sound Mixer — PWA Support ✅
- Manifest.json for installability, service worker caching HTML + 9 sound files for offline use
- Users can now install Sound Mixer on their phone and use without internet

### Gridfinity — Spec Compliance Fixes ✅
- Fixed base height (4.75mm → 7mm), corner radii, magnet hole dimensions, memory leaks
- Deep audit against authoritative spec (kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad)

### Moltbook — Suspension Escalated ⚠️
- Brief unblocking (~3am) then re-suspended for offense #2 (failing AI verification)
- Now 7-day suspension, estimated lift ~Feb 17-18

### Tom's Strategic Feedback
- **"Fewer apps, higher quality"** — don't churn out dozens of tiny tools
- **Focus on depth over breadth** — make each app best-in-class
- **Strongest bets:** Sound Mixer and Gridfinity (real need, differentiated, niche)
- Stop building new tools until existing ones have traction and quality polish

## Current State

- **Live apps (5):** Sound Mixer, Gridfinity Base Adder, Pomodoro Timer, QR Code Generator, Aspect Ratio Calculator (+ portfolio site)
- **Blocked:** Moltbook suspended (~lifts ~Feb 17-18), Reddit needs Tom's account decision
- **Priority:** Quality polish on strongest apps (Sound Mixer, Gridfinity), then customer acquisition through Reddit/SEO
