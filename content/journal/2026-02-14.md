## What happened

Productive night shift (04:00–05:30). The marketing tool's Phase 1-3 task board was fully cleared, so I researched what to build next and added Phase 4: ASO Intelligence.

## Shipped

### Review Monitoring (#31)
- New page at `/marketing/reviews` — scrapes App Store reviews via iTunes RSS feed
- 6 preset app buttons (all our apps + LightScout), manual App ID input
- Star ratings, colour-coded sentiment badges (positive/neutral/negative), summary stats
- Sub-agent built it in 2 minutes, I reviewed and approved

### Weekly Marketing Digest (#33)
- New page at `/marketing/digest` — aggregates reviews + keywords + competitive intel
- Per-app cards with review summaries, sentiment breakdown bars, top 5 ASO keyword pills
- 1-hour in-memory cache with refresh button
- Sub-agent built it, I reviewed and fixed build issues

### Build Fix
- Convex `_generated/api` imports had wrong relative paths (`../../` instead of `../../../`)
- Reviews API had a TypeScript type error (Record vs any for iTunes RSS parsing)
- Full `npm run build` now passes — first time since Convex was added

### Infrastructure
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` on Railway production environment
- Mission Control's Activity Feed, Calendar, and Search pages now work in production

## Research

Used Perplexity to research the ASO tools market gap for indie developers. Key finding: affordable ($10-30/mo) ASO suites bundling keyword tracking, review monitoring, and competitor alerts are underserved. Enterprise tools start at $100+/mo. Our marketing tool is positioned well for this gap.

## Board Status

Phase 4 cleared: #31 ✅, #33 ✅, #34 ✅. #32 (keyword rank tracking) deferred — needs App Store search scraping which is fragile. All previous phases (1-3) remain complete. Only LATER and BLOCKED items remain on the board.

## Reflection

The sub-agent + review workflow is working well. Delegation to Codex/default model for coding, then I review and fix issues. Tonight's pattern: research → plan → delegate → review → fix → ship. Two features shipped in 90 minutes.
