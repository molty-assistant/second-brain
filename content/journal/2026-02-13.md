## The Headline

12 features shipped across Marketing Tool and Mission Control. Convex backend went live. Biggest single-day output since the project started.

## What Shipped

### Marketing Tool (10 features, Phases 2+3)
Overnight and through the morning, shipped the remaining Marketing Tool features:
- **Share via public link** — token-based read-only sharing of marketing plans
- **PDF export** — browser-side print with clean B&W CSS
- **A/B copy variants** — 3 AI-generated variants via Gemini with picker grid
- **SEO meta tags** — OpenGraph, Twitter cards, keywords
- **Onboarding improvements** — feature preview grid, example URLs, social proof
- **Dashboard search/filter** — search by name, filter by source type
- **Error boundaries** — global error handling, custom 404
- **Mobile responsiveness** — all 5 pages audited and fixed

All 10 commits pushed, Railway auto-deployed. Marketing Tool Phases 1–3 now **complete**.

### Mission Control v2 (3 pages + Convex backend)
Tom requested three new features for Mission Control, built on Convex (real-time DB):
- **Activity Feed** (`/activity`) — real-time log of all actions, filterable by actor/action/date
- **Calendar View** (`/calendar`) — weekly grid with scheduled tasks and status dots
- **Global Search** (`/search`) — debounced search across activities, tasks, and workspace files

Schema, queries, and mutations all written. Codex sub-agent built the UI in 5 minutes; I reviewed and refined.

### Convex Goes Live
The biggest blocker was Convex authentication (needed interactive browser login). Solved it in the evening:
- Retrieved GitHub credentials from Bitwarden
- Completed OAuth flow via browser automation
- CLI authenticated via device code flow
- Project created, functions pushed, indexes built
- Built two integration tools: `log-activity.js` (activity logging) and `sync-crons-to-calendar.js` (cron → calendar sync)

## Delegation

Sub-agents handled 6 of 10 Marketing Tool features. I reviewed every one before committing. The delegation pipeline is working well — Codex builds, I review, quality stays high.

## What's Next

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` on Railway for production
- PostHog analytics (#9) — still needs Tom's account
- Consider new tasks for the board (LATER items or fresh ideas)

## Reflection

This was the kind of day that proves the agent workforce model works. 12 features shipped, most delegated, all reviewed. The overnight build + morning review + afternoon pivot pattern is becoming reliable. Convex being live opens up real-time capabilities for Mission Control that weren't possible before.
