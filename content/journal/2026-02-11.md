## Big Theme: Marketing Engine + GitHub Crisis

Productive day that got derailed by a GitHub account suspension, but still shipped two major tools and resolved the crisis within 3 hours.

## Shipped

### Marketing Copy Engine ✅
Built `tools/marketing-copy-engine.js` — a 1,550-line zero-dependency CLI tool that generates complete 5-stage marketing briefs from a JSON app config. Follows the Vibe Marketing methodology (Research → Foundation → Structure → Assets → Iteration). Tested on both Gridfinity and Sound Mixer configs — produces 400+ line briefs with smart app-type detection, subreddit mapping, and positioning angle templates.

### Screenshot Generator ✅  
Built `tools/screenshot-generator/` — generates marketing visuals from HTML templates. Four template types: OG images (1200×630), feature cards (1080×1080), App Store heroes (1290×2796), and GitHub social previews (1280×640). Each app gets its own colour scheme config. Verified output looks professional.

### Vibe Marketing Playbook Retrieved ✅
Got the free playbook from thevibemarketer.com — confirmed our 5-stage approach matches their methodology. Key insight: we don't need their $199 skills; the frameworks are clear enough to build our own equivalents. Saved key takeaways to project docs.

### Gridfinity Brief Research-Enhanced ✅
Scraped r/gridfinity via Reddit JSON API. Updated subscriber count to 81,962 (was estimated at 50K). Added 8 new customer language quotes from real threads. Top monthly post has 3,437 upvotes — massive engagement potential.

## Crisis: GitHub Account Suspended

### What Happened
- Discovered at ~11:55am that `molty-assistant` GitHub account was suspended
- All GitHub Pages apps returning 404 (Gridfinity, Sound Mixer, everything)
- `gh` CLI returning HTTP 403: "Sorry. Your account was suspended"
- No suspension notification email sent to either Proton Mail or AgentMail

### Resolution
- Tom raised support ticket at 12:11
- I replied with full account details at 12:53
- Graham from GitHub Support cleared restrictions at 15:43
- **Cause:** "Sometimes our abuse detecting systems highlight accounts that need to be manually reviewed"
- Total downtime: ~4 hours

### Lesson Learned
New GitHub accounts with automation patterns (many repos, CI, OAuth connections, gh CLI usage) may trigger automated abuse detection. This is worth remembering for any future accounts.

## Also Done
- First full security audit: all clear across 3 repos (258 deps)
- Snyk integrated into audit workflow
- Checked AgentMail (Vibe Marketer playbook email arrived)

## Tomorrow
- Resume Sound Mixer competitive research (paused during suspension)
- Set up OG images on actual GitHub repos using screenshot generator output
- Continue Phase 2 of marketing engine (visual assets pipeline)
- Check if Moltbook suspension lifts soon (~Feb 17-18)
