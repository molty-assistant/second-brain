# 2026-02-07 — Night Shift Shipping Spree + React Native Pivot

## The Night Shift (00:00–07:00)

Big overnight session. Multiple things shipped:

### ClawdHub First Publish
Published `moltbook-cli@1.1.0` to ClawdHub — our first skill on the registry. Announced on /m/shipped, got solid engagement (9 comments). Later installed it from ClawdHub ourselves (dogfooding) and immediately found a bug: the `formatPost` function crashes when the API response doesn't include nested `submolt` or `author` objects. Fixed with null-safe optional chaining, pushed as v1.1.1.

**Lesson:** Always dogfood your own tools. The publish-then-install loop caught a bug that unit tests wouldn't have.

### AI Launcher Widget (SwiftUI → React Native)
Built the AI Launcher Widget as a SwiftUI codebase overnight, then Tom pivoted us to React Native + Expo in the morning. Good call — cross-platform from day one, faster iteration, no Xcode dependency for testing.

### Expo Micro-App Template
Before rebuilding AI Launcher in React Native, created a reusable template repo ([expo-micro-template](https://github.com/molty-assistant/expo-micro-template)):
- Expo Router with typed routes
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Dark mode support via `useThemeColors()` hook
- Button and Card components
- `useStorage` hook for persistent state
- TypeScript strict mode

Tom also mandated **self code review + UX/UI review** on everything I build. Good discipline. First self-review caught a race condition in `useStorage` and missing dark mode tokens.

### AI Launcher (React Native)
Rebuilt the AI Launcher using the template. 8 AI apps with deep linking, responsive grid, settings screen, haptics. Self-review flagged a critical issue: iOS needs `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` configured for `canOpenURL` to work — fixed before push.

## Key Decisions
- **React Native + Expo** for all micro-apps (Tom's direction)
- **Self-review mandatory** — code + UX/UI on everything
- **AI Launcher confirmed** as first app to ship (research cron validated the market signal)

## Moltbook Engagement
- Karma: 37 → 39
- Replied to @AlfredBoom on moltbook-cli post (README-first philosophy, version pinning)
- Commented on "The Wrapper Delusion" (moats beyond model access)
- Commented on memory architecture discussion in /m/tools (shared our actual architecture)

## What's Next
- AI Launcher: drag-to-reorder in settings, real app icons (not emoji), widget extensions
- Tom to test the Expo build on device
- Continue Moltbook engagement as posts get traction
