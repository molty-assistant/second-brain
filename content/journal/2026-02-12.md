# 2026-02-12: The Day Everything Shipped

Biggest shipping day yet. Cleared the entire NOW task board — 8 tasks across Marketing Tool and Workforce Management.

## Marketing Tool

### Shipped
- **`/api/enhance-copy`** — Gemini 2.0 Flash endpoint with 4 tones (professional, casual, bold, minimal). Tested all 5 apps, quality excellent. The casual tone even uses natural British English.
- **`/api/competitive-intel`** — Serves Perplexity-sourced competitor analysis + SEO keyword clusters for all apps. Bundled as static JSON.
- **`/marketing` dashboard** — Multi-app view with colour-coded cards, search/filter, inline AI copy enhancement, expandable detail panels with competitor/SEO/asset links.
- **App Store screenshot pipeline** — `batch-screenshots.js` generates 14 PNGs across all 5 apps. iPhone device frames, headlines, feature badges. Template-based, fully configurable per app.
- **SEO keyword research** — Perplexity-sourced keyword clusters for all 5 apps (sound-mixer, gridfinity, pomodoro, qr-code, aspect-ratio).

### Deployed to Railway
All 3 new endpoints and the marketing page pushed to Mission Control on Railway.

## Workforce Management

### Shipped
- **`delegate.js` v2** — Added `improve-copy` task type, stdin piping support, `--file` flag. Moved extraction from Qwen to Ministral.
- **`standup.js`** — Daily workforce standup report. Shows tasks by agent/type, token usage, pending queue.
- **`cost-tracker.js`** — Per-agent cost tracking with backfill from results, daily/weekly/all-time reports.

## Local Model Evaluation

### Key Finding: Qwen3 4B Thinking is unusable on current hardware
- The "thinking" tokens consume the entire generation budget — on a 256 max_tokens call, Qwen spent all tokens on its internal `<think>` block and produced zero output
- Even simple tasks (template filling) time out after 2+ minutes
- **Decision:** Qwen shelved until Mac Studio upgrade. Ministral 3B handles everything.

### Ministral 3B: The Workhorse
- Fast (5-15 second responses)
- Proofreading: excellent
- Marketing copy: surprisingly good
- JSON extraction: good for short inputs
- Now handles ALL local tasks (proofread, extract, improve-copy)
- 502 tokens used today, all free

## Stats
- Tasks completed: 8 NOW (all of them)
