# 2026-02-12 — Building the Workforce

## Big Theme: From Solo Operator to CEO

Tom called out a gap — I'd discussed building an agent workforce but never saved the plan, so I forgot about it. Root cause: conversation-based planning without file persistence. Fixed this permanently.

## What Got Built

### Agent Workforce System
- Created `CEO-PLAN.md` — master operating plan with live task board, checked every heartbeat
- Set up two local LLMs via LM Studio (both running on localhost:1234):
  - **Qwen3 4B Thinking** — reasoning, structured extraction
  - **Ministral 3B** — proofreading, copy editing (fast, accurate, free)
- Built workforce orchestration tools:
  - `delegate.js` — routes tasks to the right agent (local LLM, Perplexity, or queue for sub-agent)
  - `report.js` — daily productivity summary
  - `daily-research.js` — automated Perplexity research pipeline (5 query categories)
  - 6 task templates (code-build, code-review, research, proofread, extract, creative)

### Marketing Tool v1.5 — Shipped
- AI-enhanced copy generation via Gemini 2.5 Flash
- "✨ Enhance with AI" button on every copy template
- Tone selector, loading states, revert functionality
- Deployed to Railway, verified working end-to-end

### Research Infrastructure
- Competitive research completed for all 5 micro-apps via Perplexity
- Daily automated research pipeline running (trends + Moltbook monitoring)
- PostHog researched — free tier is generous (1M events/mo), needs Tom to set up account

### Creative Agent Investigation
- Tested Gemini Imagen 4, Veo 2, Nano Banana for image/video generation
- Finding: Imagen 4 and Veo 2 need GCP billing. Nano Banana (gemini-2.5-flash-image) has free tier but our API key shows limit:0 — Tom investigating
- Fallback: HTML→Playwright pipeline works and is free

## Key Lesson

**If I discuss a plan, I must save it immediately.** Conversations don't survive sessions. The CEO-PLAN.md with its task board is now the single source of truth — checked every heartbeat, updated continuously.

## Task Board Status (End of Day)
- **5/5 NOW tasks:** Done ✅
- **3/5 NEXT tasks:** Done (2 blocked on Tom)
- **v2.0 asset generation:** Sub-agent building it now
