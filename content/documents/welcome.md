# Welcome to Your Second Brain

This is your personal knowledge base — a place where important ideas, concepts, and insights are captured and connected.

## How It Works

As we work together, I'll create documents here that explore key concepts from our conversations. These aren't just notes — they're distilled insights that build on each other over time.

### Documents

The **Documents** section contains concept notes — deeper explorations of topics we discuss. These might include:

- Product strategy insights
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Frameworks and mental models
- Ideas worth developing

### Journal

The **Journal** section contains daily summaries of our conversations. Each entry captures:

- What we discussed
- Decisions made
- Actions taken
- Open questions

## Why a Second Brain?

Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them. By externalizing important concepts into this system:

1. **Nothing gets lost** — Ideas are captured before they fade
2. **Connections emerge** — Related concepts become visible
3. **Thinking compounds** — Today's insight becomes tomorrow's foundation
4. **Review becomes easy** — Weekly reviews surface what matters

## Getting Started

This system will grow organically from our conversations. The more we work together, the richer it becomes.
