We are planning a holiday in December or Jan 2027.

We like adventure style holidays, nothing too extreme but organised where we do different things, in the past we have done holidays with much better adventures and gadventures so ones like that.

We are lookining for the trip to be around 7-10 days, we will do the adventure trip and then have a couple of days after.

We always book using avios so below is the available dates on avios.

We are in our early 40s and quite active, using much better adventures as an example we would do level 1-2 for active style, so active but nothing extreme.

Your task:

Using the available dates (some trips youll see have lots of availability with not all listed, I need you to research and check available trips that fit with the dates.

fit = we can fly out just before the start and then fly back 1-2 days later.

The organised part needs to be 7-10 days.

Then I need you to list exact possible trips and which avios flights using the availability below.

Its ok if we need to fly into and out of a different airport as long as the flights are available on avios.

Must be direct flights, no extra connecting flights
