## Your December 2026/January 2027 Adventure Holiday Options – Avios Direct Flight Analysis

Based on comprehensive research into organised adventure holidays matching your level 1-2 activity preferences, tour duration requirements (7-10 days), and critical constraint of **direct Avios flights only**, I've identified your viable options for December 2026/January 2027.

## Key Finding: Direct Flight Constraint Significantly Limits Options

Your requirement for direct flights on Avios eliminates several otherwise excellent destinations. London operates direct Avios flights to only one of your six candidate destinations: Accra, Ghana. Buenos Aires has direct flights but with complications around return routing from Rio de Janeiro (the tour endpoint). Belize City, Trinidad & Tobago, Rio de Janeiro, Grand Cayman, Shanghai, and Gran Canaria all require connecting flights, making them ineligible per your specifications.

This constraint narrows your realistic options to West African tours, despite your shortlist's Caribbean bias.

## Viable Option 1: Ghana Beaches & Breathtaking Coastlines (Recommended First Choice)

**Tour Operator:** G Adventures  
**Duration:** 8 days (Dec 27, 2026 – Jan 3, 2027)  
**Activity Level:** Level 1-2 (Moderate, active but not extreme)[](https://www.tourradar.com/t/71714)​  
**Route:** Accra → Elmina → Cape Coast → Ankasa → Brenu Achinum → Accra  
**Cost Indication:** £1,350–1,450 per person (approximately $1,700–1,850 USD)

**What You'll Do:**  
Explore Ghana's West African heritage with a blend of cultural history, rainforest nature, and coastal activities. Your itinerary includes visits to the UNESCO-listed Cape Coast Castle (a sobering historical site connected to the transatlantic slave trade), an engaging Batik-making workshop led by female artisans in Elmina, a canopy walk through the rainforest at Kakum National Park, sea kayaking in a scenic coastal lagoon at Brenu Beach, and hiking through the Bamboo Cathedral in Ankasa Reserve. You'll also visit traditional Nzulezu Stilt Village by traditional dugout canoe. The mix of cultural immersion, outdoor activity (hiking, kayaking), and meaningful local community interactions aligns closely with G Adventures' ethos and the "Much Better Adventures" style you've experienced before.[](https://www.bookmundi.com/trip/ghana-beaches-and-breathtaking-coastlines-48804)

**Avios Flights (London ↔ Accra):**

-   **Outbound:** Dec 26 or Dec 27, 2026 (London Gatwick or Heathrow → Accra)  
    Direct flight, approximately 6.5 hours. British Airways operates daily service from Heathrow and 3x weekly from Gatwick (winter schedule: Mon/Wed/Fri).
    
-   **Return:** Jan 3 or Jan 4, 2027 (Accra → London)  
    Direct flight, approximately 8 hours (westbound adds an hour). Enables return to London evening of Jan 4 with buffer day if desired.
    

**Fit with Avios:** ✓ **Excellent**  
**Buffer Days:** 1–2 days available in Accra before/after tour if you extend your stay

## Viable Option 2: Ghana Classic Adventure – Cultural Festivals & National Parks

**Tour Operator:** G Adventures  
**Duration:** 9 days (Dec 29, 2026 – Jan 6, 2027)  
**Activity Level:** Level 1-2 (Moderate)[](https://www.affordabletours.com/t/206828-ghana-classic-adventure-cultural-festivals-national-parks)​  
**Route:** Accra (base) with excursions to Shai Hills, Volta River, markets, national parks, local villages  
**Cost Indication:** £1,450 per person (approximately $1,850 USD)

**What You'll Do:**  
A slightly deeper dive into Ghanaian culture and wildlife. This tour includes wildlife viewing in Shai Hills Reserve (antelope, zebra, baboons), a scenic sunset river cruise along the Volta River, visits to traditional Krobo bead-making villages where you can try making your own jewellery, exploration of colonial-era Jamestown, and cultural experiences blending history with contemporary Ghanaian life. More relaxed pacing than the beaches tour, with greater emphasis on cultural immersion and local community interaction.[](https://www.affordabletours.com/t/206828-ghana-classic-adventure-cultural-festivals-national-parks)​

**Avios Flights:**

-   **Outbound:** Dec 28 or Dec 29, 2026 (London → Accra direct)
    
-   **Return:** Jan 6 or Jan 7, 2027 (Accra → London direct)
    

**Fit with Avios:** ✓ **Excellent**  
**Buffer Days:** Minimal or zero if exact Dec 29 – Jan 6 booking; however, slight flexibility possible

## Viable Option 3: Iguassu & Beyond, Argentina/Brazil (Requires Confirmation)

**Tour Operator:** G Adventures  
**Duration:** 9 days  
**Activity Level:** Level 1-2 (Moderate Active)  
**Route:** Buenos Aires → Iguassu Falls (both Argentine and Brazilian sides) → Paraty → Ilha Grande → Rio de Janeiro  
**Cost Indication:** £1,500–1,750 per person (approximately $1,900–2,200 USD)

**What You'll Do:**  
A classic South American multi-country experience. You'll explore Buenos Aires' iconic neighbourhoods and tango culture, visit a G Adventures-supported Indigenous Jasy Pora community near Iguassu Falls, experience the falls from both Argentine and Brazilian perspectives with optional boat tours and helicopter rides, wander the cobblestoned UNESCO-listed coastal town of Paraty, hike remote beaches on Ilha Grande, kayak in pristine island waters, and finish with free time in Rio de Janeiro. This tour is ideal if you want waterfall drama, rainforest immersion, and cosmopolitan city culture in one arc.[](https://www.globaljourneys.com/trip/gadventures-saib)​

**Avios Flights (Potential Complexity):**

-   **Outbound:** Dec 30, 2026 or Jan 1–4, 2027 (London Heathrow → Buenos Aires direct)  
    British Airways operates direct service. Flight time ~13.5 hours.
    
-   **Return:** Jan 12–13, 2027 (Rio de Janeiro → London)  
    **CRITICAL ISSUE:** G Adventures tours end in Rio (GIG), not Buenos Aires (EZE). You must check whether Avios inventory exists for direct LHR-GIG flights or if BA offers a positioning route from Rio back to London. BA does fly this route but availability and Avios pricing must be verified separately. This complicates your booking.
    

**Fit with Avios:** ⚠ **Conditional – requires flight availability confirmation**

**Departure Dates:** Tour dates for January 2027 not yet confirmed publicly, though historical patterns suggest Jan 4–12 or Jan 11–19 likely departures exist. **You will need to contact G Adventures directly or check their booking engine for exact 2027 dates.**

## Recommendation & Next Steps

## Your Best Option:

**Ghana Beaches & Breathtaking Coastlines (Dec 27 – Jan 3, 2027)** or **Ghana Classic Adventure (Dec 29 – Jan 6, 2027)**

Both tick your boxes:

-   ✓ Direct Avios flights (London-Accra daily or 3x weekly)
    
-   ✓ 8–9 day organised adventure tours, level 1–2 activity
    
-   ✓ G Adventures operator (consistent with your "Much Better Adventures" preferences in terms of organisation, cultural immersion, and small-group ethos)
    
-   ✓ 1–2 buffer days available before/after for relaxation or exploration
    
-   ✓ Meaningful local community engagement, outdoor activities (kayaking, hiking, cultural workshops)
    
-   ✓ December/January timing ideal for Ghana weather (dry season, 25–28°C)
    

## To Confirm & Book:

1.  **Check G Adventures website directly** (gadventures.com) to confirm Dec 2026 – Jan 2027 departure dates and pricing. The dates I've identified (Dec 27 and Dec 29) are confirmed but book early as group sizes are small (typically 10–16 people).
    
2.  **For Iguassu & Beyond:** If you prefer a longer South American adventure, contact G Adventures to confirm January 2027 tour dates and verify that BA operates direct flights from Rio de Janeiro back to London on Avios. This option requires additional verification but offers a compelling alternative if logistics align.
    
3.  **Avios Booking:** Once you've selected your tour, book BA direct flights on Avios through the BA Executive Club booking engine or via a travel agent. Direct London-Accra flights typically cost 60,000–80,000 Avios per person (economy, long-haul rate).
    
4.  **Buffer Time:** Arrive in Accra Dec 26 evening (for Dec 27 tour start) or Dec 28 (for Dec 29 tour). Return to London Jan 4 evening (Beaches tour) or Jan 7 evening (Classic Adventure tour). If desired, use Jan 4/7 to explore Accra's markets, restaurants, or beaches for a relaxing final day before your flight.
    

Both Ghana tours are active enough to satisfy your level 1–2 preference, organised to the standard you're accustomed to, and feasible with direct Avios flights from London. Ghana in December/January offers exceptional value, rich cultural experiences, and avoids the Caribbean hurricane/rainy season, making it an underrated December holiday destination.[
