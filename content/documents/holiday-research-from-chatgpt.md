# Avios-aligned adventure holidays for December 2026 to January 2027

## Scope and assumptions

You said you’re planning for December or January 2027, want an organised adventure-style trip (active but not extreme), with the *organised* portion lasting 7–10 days, plus 1–2 extra days afterwards for downtime.

Your pasted Avios availability list is labelled “January 2026–focused trips”, and some dates show December 2025. As of today (1 February 2026), those dates would be in the past, so I’ve treated your list as a *winter 2026/27 Avios calendar* (i.e., Dec 2026 and Jan 2027) because that’s the only way it matches your stated travel window. If that interpretation is wrong, the matching below won’t hold.

Where you wrote “must be direct flights”, I’ve treated that as **non-stop flights** (no change of aircraft and no intermediate stop). Where a route appears to be “direct” but with a stop (one flight number that stops en route), I call that out explicitly so you can decide if it meets your personal rule.

## Direct-flight feasibility by destination

Some of the airports you listed are served by genuinely non-stop flights from London, and some aren’t.

* **London ⇄ Port of Spain (POS)**: British Airways states it operates a *direct* (non-stop) flight from London Gatwick to Port of Spain, with a ~9h10 flight time. citeturn36view0  
* **London ⇄ Rio de Janeiro (GIG)**: British Airways states London Heathrow to Galeão takes just over ~11h30. citeturn36view2  
* **London ⇄ São Paulo (GRU)**: British Airways states London to São Paulo takes ~11h40. citeturn36view3  
* **London ⇄ Accra (ACC)**: British Airways states London to Accra takes ~6h35. citeturn36view4  
* **London ⇄ Shanghai (PVG)**: British Airways states London to Shanghai Pudong takes ~11h45. citeturn36view5  
* **London ⇄ Gran Canaria (LPA)**: British Airways markets London ↔ Gran Canaria as a direct short-haul route (just over ~4 hours). citeturn36view6  

Two of your “January-focused” ideas are problematic under a strict non-stop rule:

* **London ⇄ Buenos Aires (EZE)**: British Airways’ Buenos Aires page explicitly says the Heathrow→Ezeiza flight “includes a short stop in Rio de Janeiro”. citeturn14view0  
* **London ⇄ Grand Cayman (GCM)**: Skyscanner states “No airlines currently offer direct flights between London and Owen Roberts International Airport” (i.e., non-stop). citeturn36view1 British Airways also notes a “quick stop on the way” for Cayman. citeturn14view2  

So, if “direct” means **no stop**, Cayman and Buenos Aires drop out. If you’re OK with a *through-flight with a stop* (no plane change), Buenos Aires may still be workable (but it still isn’t non-stop). citeturn14view0  

## Exact trip matches

image_group{"layout":"carousel","aspect_ratio":"16:9","query":["Iguazu Falls Brazil Argentina viewpoint","Volta River Ghana sunset cruise","Roque Nublo Gran Canaria hiking trail","Asa Wright Nature Centre Trinidad rainforest"] ,"num_per_query":1}

### entity["country","Ghana","west africa country"] — 9-day small-group adventure based in entity["city","Accra","ghana capital city"]

**Trip:** entity["company","G Adventures","small group travel operator"] — *Ghana Classic Adventure: Cultural Festivals & National Parks* (9 days). citeturn9search0turn37view0  
**Why it fits your “active but not extreme” brief:** it’s a culture-and-nature itinerary with multiple light-to-moderate activity days (e.g., visits to Shai Hills Reserve, a Volta River sunset cruise, and a hike/climb day for Mount Afadjato + Wli Falls listed in the itinerary inclusions). citeturn37view0  
**Fixed departure that lands well with a Dec/Jan break:** Global Journeys lists a departure **Tue 29 Dec 2026 → Wed 6 Jan 2027**. citeturn9search4  

**Avios flight fit (direct, non-stop):**  
British Airways markets London ↔ Accra as a direct route (~6h35). citeturn36view4 Your own Avios notes say Accra is “highly flexible” across Dec/Jan, so you can make this line up cleanly.

A clean “tight but sensible” pairing would look like:

* **Fly out:** Mon 28 Dec 2026 (London → ACC, direct)  
* **Tour:** Tue 29 Dec 2026 → Wed 6 Jan 2027 (9 days) citeturn9search4  
* **Downtime:** Thu 7 Jan + Fri 8 Jan (2 days, beach/city)  
* **Fly back:** Fri 8 Jan 2027 or Sat 9 Jan 2027 (ACC → London, direct)  

This is one of the best matches in your whole list because the tour is exactly in your 7–10 day band and the flights are non-stop and flexible.

### entity["place","Gran Canaria","canary islands spain"] — 8-day guided walking with a base and transfers

**Trip:** entity["company","Explore Worldwide","adventure travel company"] — *Canary Islands Walking – Gran Canaria* (8 days / 7 nights, “Moderate” walking grade). citeturn12view0  
This is organised, multi-day, active, and lands inside your 7–10 day organised window (8 days). citeturn12view0  

**Key dates that match a Dec/Jan holiday window:** Explore lists multiple fixed departures, including:  
* **Sat 26 Dec 2026 → Sat 2 Jan 2027** citeturn12view0  
* **Sat 9 Jan 2027 → Sat 16 Jan 2027** citeturn12view0  

**Avios flight fit (direct, non-stop):**  
British Airways markets London ↔ Gran Canaria as direct (just over ~4 hours). citeturn36view6 Your Avios notes say Gran Canaria has “many dates” both out and back across late Dec/early Jan and across January, so it’s naturally flexible for adding 1–2 rest days.

Two “fit” examples:

* **Option A (New Year finish):**
  * Fly out: Fri 25 Dec 2026 (London → LPA, direct)  
  * Tour: Sat 26 Dec 2026 → Sat 2 Jan 2027 citeturn12view0  
  * Downtime: Sun 3 Jan + Mon 4 Jan  
  * Fly back: Mon 4 Jan 2027 (or Tue 5 Jan) (LPA → London, direct)

* **Option B (January slot):**
  * Fly out: Fri 8 Jan 2027 (London → LPA, direct)  
  * Tour: Sat 9 Jan 2027 → Sat 16 Jan 2027 citeturn12view0  
  * Downtime: Sun 17 Jan + Mon 18 Jan  
  * Fly back: Mon 18 Jan 2027 (or Tue 19 Jan) (LPA → London, direct)

This is a strong “low-jetlag, high-value” option where the admin burden stays low because the flights are short and frequent.

### entity["country","Trinidad and Tobago","caribbean nation"] — a 10-day nature-focused organised trip starting from entity["city","Port of Spain","trinidad capital city"]

**Trip:** entity["company","Naturalist Journeys","wildlife tour operator"] — *Trinidad & Tobago: Incredible Birds & Wildlife* (10 days / 9 nights), listed as “Coming January 2027”. citeturn17view0  
The page is specifically dated **2027/01/04** (the tour date embedded in the URL) and describes it as a **10-day/9-night** trip. citeturn17view0  

This is less “multi-sport” and more “active nature” (walks, wetlands/boat time, rainforest time). If your must-have is kayaking/cycling/climbing variety, it may feel narrower; if you like wildlife and being outdoors every day, it’s a good match.

**Avios flight fit (direct, non-stop):**  
British Airways states it flies directly (non-stop) from London Gatwick to Port of Spain. citeturn36view0 Your POS Avios availability is very specific and includes **4 Jan** departures and **15 Jan** returns, which creates a clean fit with a 4 Jan start and a couple of days after.

A clean pairing (using your POS Avios dates as written):

* **Fly out (direct):** Sat 3 Jan 2027 isn’t in your list, so the tightest listed option is **Sat 4 Jan 2027** (LGW → POS, direct).  
* **Tour:** starts **Mon 4 Jan 2027** (page date) and is **10 days / 9 nights**. citeturn17view0  
  *If Day 1 is 4 Jan, Day 10 would typically land on 13 Jan (10-day duration), but the operator page segment visible in the web capture doesn’t explicitly print the end date, so treat the 13 Jan end-date as a simple calendar implication of “10-day tour starting 4 Jan”.* citeturn17view0  
* **Fly back (direct):** **Thu 15 Jan 2027** (POS → LGW, direct) gives you ~1–2 buffer days after the trip, depending on when the final day ends.  

If you want a tighter “fly out just before the start” pattern, POS is actually awkward because your listed outbound Avios dates jump from 1 Jan to 4 Jan; there’s no 2–3 Jan option in what you pasted.

### entity["country","Brazil","south american country"] to entity["country","Argentina","south american country"] — 9-day “highlights + nature” trip ending in entity["city","Rio de Janeiro","brazil city"]

This is the best “big-ticket adventure, warm weather, different places” fit I found that lands cleanly in early January 2027 **and** sits at an accessible intensity level — but it conflicts with your strict “direct/no stop” rule if you interpret that as “no intermediate stops”.

**Trip:** *Iguassu & Beyond* (9 days), starting in entity["city","Buenos Aires","argentina capital city"] and finishing in Rio. citeturn13search0turn37view1  
A reseller summary lists **average age 45** and **physical rating 2/5**, which is very close to your “active level 1–2” target in spirit. citeturn37view1  
Global Journeys lists a departure **Mon 4 Jan 2027 → Tue 12 Jan 2027**. citeturn13search8  

**Avios flight fit (direct/non-stop on the Brazil leg; questionable on the Argentina leg):**
* British Airways states Heathrow → Rio (GIG) is ~11h30. citeturn36view2  
* British Airways’ Buenos Aires page says the Heathrow → EZE routing “includes a short stop in Rio de Janeiro”. citeturn14view0  

So:
* If you require **no stops at all**, this option fails on the outbound (London → Buenos Aires) even if you don’t change planes. citeturn14view0  
* If your real constraint is **no connections / no changing planes**, it could still be acceptable because BA frames it as a single journey with a stop, but you’d need to be comfortable with that nuance. citeturn14view0  

**If you *do* allow the BA “stop but no connection” interpretation**, a very clean pairing with your listed Avios dates would be:

* **Fly out:** Sun 3 Jan 2027 (London → EZE, “direct” but with stop per BA) citeturn14view0  
* **Tour:** Mon 4 Jan 2027 → Tue 12 Jan 2027 (9 days) citeturn13search8  
* **Downtime:** Wed 13 Jan + Thu 14 Jan (in Rio; beach + food + recovery)  
* **Fly back:** Wed 13 Jan 2027 (GIG → London, non-stop) using your Rio return date citeturn36view2  

This is exactly the pattern you asked for: fly out just before, fly back 1 day after, with the organised portion bang in the 7–10 day range.

## Near-misses and risks

### entity["place","Cayman Islands","caribbean territory"]

You listed Grand Cayman (GCM) with attractive Avios availability, but it is the least compatible with your “direct-only” flight rule.

* Skyscanner explicitly says **no airlines currently offer direct (non-stop) flights** between London and the Owen Roberts airport. citeturn36view1  
* British Airways also describes Cayman flights from Heathrow as having “a quick stop on the way”. citeturn14view2  

There *are* 7-night organised liveaboard dive products in the Cayman Islands market (e.g., Cayman Aggressor IV is sold as an 8 days / 7 nights itinerary on Liveaboard.com). citeturn34view1 But unless you’re willing to relax the “non-stop” rule, it’s hard to keep this on your shortlist for an Avios-driven, direct-flight trip.

### entity["city","Shanghai","china megacity"]

Flights are straightforward (BA markets London → Shanghai Pudong at ~11h45). citeturn36view5 The blocker is that your message doesn’t include *any* candidate 7–10 day “adventure style” tours that start and end in Shanghai with confirmed Jan 2027 departure dates, and I don’t want to invent a shortlist without being able to verify departure schedules against your exact PVG Avios dates.

## Recommendation summary

If you want the cleanest fit against **all** your constraints (7–10 days organised + 1–2 rest days + direct non-stop flights), the strongest, fully evidenced matches from your list are:

* **Accra / Ghana + G Adventures (9 days)**: best “big trip” candidate because the tour has a fixed 29 Dec 2026–6 Jan 2027 departure window and flights are non-stop. citeturn9search4turn36view4  
* **Gran Canaria + Explore (8 days)**: best “low admin, reliable weather, easy flights” candidate with fixed dates spanning both late Dec and January. citeturn12view0turn36view6  
* **Port of Spain / Trinidad & Tobago + Naturalist Journeys (10 days)**: workable if you like wildlife-focused activity and your Avios dates line up (especially 4 Jan out / 15 Jan back). citeturn17view0turn36view0  

If you’re willing to treat “direct” as “no plane change, but a stop is OK”, then **Iguassu & Beyond (9 days)** becomes the best “variety of places + iconic nature + beach finish” early-January option, and it aligns neatly with your noted early January flight windows. citeturn13search8turn14view0turn36view2
