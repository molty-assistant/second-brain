Here is the full report comparing the three best adventure holidays that fit your specific December 2026 – January 2027 constraints.

I have matched **real-world tour schedules** (based on typical January departures) with your **specific Avios flight availability**.

### **Executive Summary**

| Option | Adventure Vibe | Activity Level | Best For... | Flight Route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1\. Brazil Green Coast** | Jungle, Colonial Towns, Islands | Moderate (2/5) | A perfect mix of culture, beach, and activity without internal flights. | LHR ↔ Rio (Direct) |
| **2\. Gran Canaria Traverse** | High Mountain Trekking | Active (3/5) | Pure hiking, zero jet lag, and maximum time on the trail. | LHR ↔ Las Palmas (Direct) |
| **3\. The BA to Rio Crossing** | Overland Travel, 3 Countries | Moderate (2/5) | Seeing it all (Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil) in one epic 10-day sweep. | LHR → BA / Rio → LHR |

### **Option 1: The "Green Coast" Adventure (Brazil)**

**Trip:** _Best of Brazil_ (Intrepid Travel) or similar by G Adventures. **The Concept:** This is the most logical "Adventure" fit. It avoids the thousands of miles of travel required to get to the Amazon or Pantanal, focusing instead on the "Green Coast" (Costa Verde) south of Rio. You get car-free jungle islands, colonial history, and hiking without needing a single internal flight.

#### **The Itinerary (8 Days)**

-   **Day 1:** Arrive in **Rio de Janeiro**. Meet the group.
    
-   **Day 2-3:** Travel to **Paraty** (UNESCO colonial town). Hike the "Gold Trail" (Caminho do Ouro) in the jungle and take a schooner boat to secluded beaches.
    
-   **Day 4-6:** Ferry to **Ilha Grande**. This is a car-free island. You will hike through the Atlantic rainforest to _Lopes Mendes_ beach (often voted one of the world's best) and kayak in the clear waters.
    
-   **Day 7:** Return to **Rio de Janeiro**. Farewell dinner/Samba.
    
-   **Day 8:** Tour ends in Rio.
    

#### **The Logistics (Your Dates)**

-   **Outbound Flight:** Depart LHR **Jan 2** → Arrive Rio (GIG) **Jan 3** (AM).
    
-   **Pre-Trip:** Jan 3 (Relax at Copacabana).
    
-   **Trip Start:** **Jan 4**. (Intrepid/G Adventures run this route weekly).
    
-   **Trip End:** **Jan 11**.
    
-   **Relax:** Jan 12 (Rio).
    
-   **Return Flight:** Depart Rio (GIG) **Jan 13** → Arrive LHR Jan 14.
    

#### **Why this wins:**

-   **Zero Internal Flights:** You travel by private van and ferry.
    
-   **Fits Avios Perfectly:** Uses the specific Jan 2 outbound and Jan 13 return availability you found.

### **Option 2: The "Volcanic Traverse" (Gran Canaria)**

**Trip:** _Hike the Volcanic Island of Gran Canaria_ (Much Better Adventures). **The Concept:** Forget the beach resorts. This trip crosses the rugged interior of the island, staying in cave houses and mountain paradors. It is physically more active than the Brazil trip but logistically much simpler.

#### **The Itinerary (8 Days)**

-   **Day 1:** Arrive **Las Palmas**. Transfer to the Agaete Valley (coffee plantations).
    
-   **Day 2-3:** Trek the _Tamadaba Natural Park_. Dramatic cliff-edge paths and views of Mount Teide (Tenerife).
    
-   **Day 4-5:** Hike to **Roque Nublo** (the cloud rock) and the caldera of Tejeda. Stay in a high-altitude mountain village.
    
-   **Day 6-7:** Descent through the pine forests to the white-washed villages of the north.
    
-   **Day 8:** Finish in Las Palmas.
    

#### **The Logistics (Your Dates)**

-   **Outbound Flight:** Depart LHR **Jan 2** → Arrive Las Palmas (LPA).
    
-   **Trip Start:** **Jan 3**. (These trips are very flexible and often run "self-guided" for couples if a group date isn't exact).
    
-   **Trip End:** **Jan 10**.
    
-   **Relax:** Jan 10–12. Stay at a boutique hotel in _Vegueta_ (Las Palmas Old Town) for tapas and culture.
    
-   **Return Flight:** Depart LPA **Jan 13** → Arrive LHR.
    

#### **Why this wins:**

-   **Maximum Activity:** If your main goal is "doing things" rather than "seeing sights," this is the best hiking value.
    
-   **No Jet Lag:** You land and start adventuring immediately.

### **Option 3: The South American Crossing (Argentina to Brazil)**

**Trip:** _Best of Argentina, Uruguay & Brazil_ (Intrepid Travel). **The Concept:** A fast-paced overland journey that hits three countries. It matches your adventurous spirit but requires an "Open Jaw" flight booking (Into BA, Out of Rio), which Avios allows.

#### **The Itinerary (10 Days)**

-   **Day 1:** Arrive **Buenos Aires**. Tango and steak.
    
-   **Day 2:** Ferry across the Rio de la Plata to **Colonia, Uruguay** (cobblestone streets).
    
-   **Day 3-5:** Stay at a traditional **Estancia** (Ranch) in Uruguay. Horse riding and gauging culture.
    
-   **Day 6:** Overnight bus (a true adventure rite of passage!) or transfer to **Iguazu Falls**.
    
-   **Day 7-8:** Explore **Iguazu Falls** (both Argentine and Brazilian sides).
    
-   **Day 9:** Fly/Bus to **Rio de Janeiro**.
    
-   **Day 10:** Trip ends in Rio.
    

#### **The Logistics (Your Dates)**

-   **Outbound Flight:** Depart LHR **Jan 2** → Arrive Buenos Aires (EZE) **Jan 3**.
    
-   **Trip Start:** **Jan 3 or 4**.
    
-   **Trip End:** **Jan 12 or 13** (in Rio).
    
-   **Return Flight:** Depart Rio (GIG) **Jan 13** → Arrive LHR Jan 14.
    
    -   _Note:_ This relies on the trip ending on the morning of the 13th, or you leaving the tour 12 hours early if it runs late, but usually, Day 10 is a "departure day" with no activities.
        

#### **Why this wins:**

-   **The "Traveler" Badge:** You cross a continent in 10 days.
    
-   **Variety:** You get city, ranch, jungle, waterfall, and beach all in one.

### **Recommendation**

**I recommend Option 1 (Brazil Green Coast).**

It fits your brief best because:

1.  **Pacing:** It allows for the "couple of days after" to relax in Rio, which Option 3 (The Crossing) barely permits due to the tight schedule.
    
2.  **Logistics:** It uses a simple Return flight (LHR-GIG) rather than a Multi-City, making the Avios booking easier to secure.
    
3.  **Vibe:** It is exactly the "Much Better Adventures" style—kayaking, hiking, and culture—without being extreme.
    

**Next Step for You:** Go to **ba.com** (or your Avios portal) and check if you can book the **LHR to Rio (GIG)** seats for **Jan 2 outbound** and **Jan 13 inbound**.

If those seats are live, you should book them immediately (Avios seats disappear fast), then you can leisurely book the **Intrepid "Best of Brazil"** or **G Adventures "Wonders of Brazil"** closer to the time.
