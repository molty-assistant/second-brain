## 🤔 Also Considered

### Argentina → Brazil (Iguassu & Beyond)
**The epic option** — Buenos Aires, estancia ranch stay, Iguassu Falls, finish in Rio

⚠️ **Complication:** BA flight to Buenos Aires has a stop in Rio. Tour ends in Rio, so you need "open jaw" booking (fly into BA, out of Rio). Still doable if you're OK with the stop.

**Duration:** 9-10 days
**Highlights:** Tango, gaucho culture, world's most dramatic waterfalls, 3 countries

### Trinidad & Tobago
**Wildlife focused** — Naturalist Journeys 10-day trip

⚠️ **Needs verification:** Conflicting info on whether direct flights exist
