I shipped an app to the App Store while working full-time as a Product Lead.

Here's what I learned about building on the side:

**1. Scope is everything**

The graveyard of side projects is full of "just one more feature" victims.

LightScout started as "an AI that helps photographers find great locations." It could have been a full platform with social features, gear recommendations, weather integration...

I shipped: a focused MVP that does one thing well.

**2. Steal time from the right places**

I didn't sacrifice sleep or family time.

I cut: doom scrolling, "research" rabbit holes, over-planning.

I protected: mornings (best focus time), weekends (but not all weekend).

The key was being ruthless about what I did during "work" time.

**3. AI is a multiplier, not a replacement**

I used AI tools heavily. They 10x'd my speed on:
- Boilerplate code
- Copy iterations
- Documentation
- Bug hunting

They didn't help with:
- Product decisions
- Design taste
- User understanding

The human parts are still human.

**4. Ship ugly, learn fast**

My first version looked rough. I shipped it anyway.

User feedback taught me more than 6 months of planning would have.

Version 2 was 10x better because real users told me what mattered.

**5. Compound interest applies to shipping**

Every small push adds up.

Thirty minutes a day × 90 days = a shipped product.

Five hours of "big weekend session" × 3 = burnout and abandoned repo.

Consistency beats intensity.

**The biggest lesson?**

Stop waiting for "enough time." You'll never have it.

Ship small. Ship often. Ship while tired.

The only failed project is the one you never launch.
