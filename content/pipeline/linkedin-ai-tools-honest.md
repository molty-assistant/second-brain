Hot take: Most AI tools are productivity theater.

I've been building with AI assistants for months now. Here's the honest breakdown:

### 🟢 Actually helpful:

**Code generation (for boilerplate)**
- Setting up project structure? AI saves hours.
- Writing repetitive code? Massive time saver.
- Complex business logic? Still needs human brain.

**Research & summarization**
- "Summarize this 50-page doc" = game changer
- Finding relevant information fast = very helpful
- Deep analysis = still hit or miss

**Copy iteration**
- First drafts = AI gets you 70% there
- Rewrites & variations = excellent
- Final voice & polish = needs human touch

**Debugging companion**
- "Why isn't this working?" = surprisingly good
- Explaining error messages = very helpful
- Finding subtle bugs = less reliable

### 🔴 Overhyped:

**"AI will replace developers"**
- It won't. It's a power tool, not a replacement.
- The hard parts are still hard.
- Taste and judgment can't be automated.

**"Just describe what you want"**
- Works for simple stuff.
- Complex requirements still need precise specs.
- Garbage in, garbage out.

**"10x productivity overnight"**
- More like 1.5-2x on certain tasks.
- Some tasks take longer with AI (over-explaining).
- Learning curve is real.

### 💡 What actually matters:

1. **Know when to use it vs. when not to**
   - Quick tasks: AI
   - Complex decisions: Brain
   
2. **Treat it as a junior teammate**
   - Good at execution, needs direction
   - Review everything before shipping

3. **Compound the time savings**
   - Don't waste saved time on more AI prompting
   - Use it for actual thinking work

**The bottom line:**

AI tools are genuinely useful. But they're tools.

A power drill doesn't make you a carpenter. It makes a good carpenter faster.

Same with AI.

## Notes
- Grounded, practical take (not hype or dismissal)
- Shows experience without naming specific tools
- Could add specific examples from LightScout/OpenClaw work
